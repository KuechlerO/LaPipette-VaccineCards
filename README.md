# LaPipette-VaccineCards
This repo is used by the LaPipette-App to dynamically fetch the card-images. 
This way, we can ensure the up-to-date quality of the displayed info-cards, regardless which app-version is installed.

The subsequent lines have each the following structure: "ID"-"Vaccination name"
